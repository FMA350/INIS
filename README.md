# INISS ("Irish Naturalization and Immigration Service" Service)) 
A small python script that constantly checks if an appointment for the INIS is available.

The INIS website does not work properly and booking an appointment is nearly immpossibile (due to script-kiddies in Germany booking every single appointment for online sales! oh the humanity!) If you are one of the unlucky ones (like me) who recently moved to Ireland and cannot get an appointment, this script may help you!
INISS checks every 10 seconds if an appointment is available [for the three cathegories: work, study and other]. You will have to modify the "values" section of the script to fit your needs. If you do not have any idea how to do that, well, tough luck!

THIS IS FREE SOFTWARE, FREE as in "Free beer", use it as you wish. I am not responsibile if it wipes up your hard-drive (you back-up your data don't you?)


Cheers
